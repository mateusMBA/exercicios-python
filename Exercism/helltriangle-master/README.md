#Hell Triangle - Challenge
Given a triangle of numbers, find the maximum total from top to bottom.

Example:

       6        
      3 5
     9 7 1
    4 6 8 4
    
In this triangle the maximum total is:  6 + 5 + 7 + 8 = 26

An element can only be summed with one of the two nearest elements in the next row. For example: 
The element 3 in the 2nd row can only be summed with 9 and 7, but not with 1

The code will receive an (multidimensional) array as input.

The triangle from above would be:

```python
example = [[6],[3,5],[9,7,1],[4,6,8,4]]
```

## Dev

Install Libs
```shell
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The method maximum_top_to_bottom receive and validate the triangle array by your struct. If the struct is not valid an exception message will appear.

```python
from hellstriangle import maximum_top_to_bottom
example = [[6],[3,5],[9,7,1],[4,6,8,4]]
maximum_top_to_bottom(example)
```

It is also possible to generate a triangle in a random way, being necessary to inform the height of the triangle.

```python
from hellstriangle import generate_random_triangle
generate_random_triangle(5)
```
